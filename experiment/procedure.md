Start the experiment with default values of floors' mass and stiffness and mode of vibration. Pause the experiment after a few cycles and observe the response of all the different floors for the same parameters.

**Observation 1:**

Vary the mass and stiffness of the floors and note the corresponding variations in their time period.

**Observation 2:**

Vary the mode of vibration parameter and note the corresponding variations in all the floors' responses for the different values.
