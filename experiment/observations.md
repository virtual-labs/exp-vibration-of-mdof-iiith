Observation 1: Finding natural frequencies and mode shapes

1. Take n storey structure.
2. Input mass and stiffness of each storey
3. Run the experiment. User can see eigen values (natural frequencies) and eigen vectors (mode shapes).
4. Use may note the eigen vectors and check for modal orthogonality.

Observation 2: Find the response of the structure to given ground motion.

5. Take n storey structure.
6. Input mass and stiffness of each storey.
7. Select ground motion and also damping.
8. Run the experiment. User can find the response of the each floor level on the screen. User can also find the response of each mode.
